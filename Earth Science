#Flow Duration Curves to Determine Characteristics and Estimate Potential Flow
##Why it is interesting?

MAIN TAKEAWAY: "This notebook uses the Scientific Python (scipy) stack tools to generate flow duration curves from current USGS NWIS data."
I find this intersting because I have always had a passion for Earth Science/Basins. A Basin is defined as "A basin is a depression, or dip, in the Earthâ€™s surface." I think it is very cool that a topic like this can be estimated using code!
